    <h2><strong>About Amy Tan</strong></h2>
    <p><img src="images/Amy Tan1.jpg"  alt="" id="contentPhoto"/>Amy Tan is the author of THE JOY LUCK CLUB, THE KITCHEN GOD'S WIFE, THE HUNDRED SECRET SENSES, THE BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER, THE OPPOSITE OF FATE: Memories of a Writing Life, SAVING FISH FROM DROWNING, and two children's books, THE MOON LADY andSAGWA, which was adapted into a PBS Kids production. Tan was also a coproducer and coscreenwriter of the film version of THE JOY LUCK CLUB. Her essays and stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies, and her work has been translated into 35 languages. She lives with her husband in San Francisco and New York.</p>
    <p>As a child Amy Tan believed her life was duller than most. She read to escape. Her parents wanted her to be a doctor and a concert pianist. She secretly dreamed of becoming an artist. She began writing fiction when she was 33. Her first short story was published when she was 34, and three years later, she published her first book, a collection of short stories called The Joy Luck Club, which the critics reviewed as a novel.</p>
    <p>Tan was born in Oakland, California. She is the second of three  children born to Chinese immigrants Daisy (née Li), and John Tan, an electrical  engineer and Baptist minister. When Tan was 15 years old, her older brother  Peter and father both died of brain tumors within eight months of each other.  Daisy moved Amy and her younger brother John Jr. to Switzerland, where Amy  finished high school, at the Institut Monte Rosa, Montreux. During this period  in her life, Amy learned about her mother's former marriage to an abusive man  in China, of their four children (a son who died as a toddler, and three  daughters) and how her mother was forced to leave her children from a previous  marriage behind in Shanghai. This incident provided the basis for Tan's first  novel, 1989 New York Times bestseller The Joy Luck Club. In 1987 Amy traveled  with Daisy to China. There, Amy met her three half-sisters.</p>
    <p>Tan began her college days at Linfield College in Oregon before  transferring to San José State University in California because she had fallen  in love with Lou DeMattei, an Italian American. Tan received her bachelor's and  master's degrees in English and linguistics from San José State, and later did  doctoral linguistics studies at UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley. While in school,  she worked odd jobs—switchboard operator, carhop, bartender, and pizza  maker—before starting a writing career. As a freelance business writer, she  worked on projects for AT&amp;T, IBM, Bank of America and Pacific Bell.</p>
    <p>In a New York Times &quot;Room for Debate&quot; piece  &quot;Deconstructing Lyme Disease&quot;, &quot;My Plight with the  Illness&quot;, Amy Tan discussed her late-stage case.</p>
    <p>She resides in Sausalito, California, with her husband, DeMattei, in a  house they designed &quot;to feel open and airy, like a tree house, but also to  be a place where we could live comfortably into old age,&quot; with  accessibility features. He is a tax attorney whom she met on a blind date and  married in 1974.</p>

    <h2><strong>Quates</strong></h2>
    <p>Some quotes from her books or tweets. Here is a memory log. </p>
    <p>I felt I were running in a labyrinth, chasing after something I could  not see yet knew as important. I sened it was just ahead, and then it would go  around a corner, and I would be lost. I would have to decide what to do next,  where to go, and what I needed to get out of that confusing polace.  If I stopped running and stood still, I would  be accepting that what I had was all I would ever have. I would no longer be  lost, because there would be nowhere else to go.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from &quot;The Valley of Amazement.&quot;</em></p>
    <p>&quot;You are too young to know yet what nostalgia truly means. It  takes time to become sentimental. But for the sake of your success you must  quickly learn.  When you touch a man's  nostalgia, he is yours.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from &quot;The Valley of Amazement.&quot;</em></p>
    <p>&quot;I learned by patience and persistence that everything has a point  of balance. You just have to find it.     <br>
      <em>-from a tweet a on learning to balance  rocks  </em></p>
    <p>In two years' time, my scar became pale and shiny and I had no memory  of my mother.  This is the way it is with  a wound. The wound begins to close in on itself, to protect what is hurting so  much. And once it is closed, you no longer remember what is underneath, what  started the pain.     <br>
      <em>-from &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; </em></p>
    <p>&quot;It was one of those Chinese expressions that means the better  half of good intentions.  I can't remember  things I didn't understand in the first place.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from&quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;</em></p>
    <p>&quot;Good intentions do not absolve one of responsibility for harm  done to another. Justifying oneself does absolve blame.&quot;<br>
      <em>-from a Tweeted though</em></p>
    <p>&quot;Desire for forgiveness does not absolve on of blame. Forgiveness  is the grace of the forgiver to no longer speak of blame.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from a Tweeted thought </em></p>
    <p>&quot;Those who are forgiven should not feel cleansed of guilt.  They should be grateful and eager to make amends.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from Tweeted thought </em><br>
      &quot;Betrayal is never unintentional.   It knowingly absconds trust in exchange for self-profit.  Power is self-profit.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from a Tweeted thought </em></p>
    <p>&quot;It's both rebellion and conformity that attack you with  success..&quot;   <br>
      <em>-from someone's Tweet who said I said this </em></p>
    <p>&quot;My mother didn't teach me lessons about being Chinese as strongly  as she did the notion of who I was as a female.&quot; <br>
      <em>-from &quot;THe Boomer List&quot; on PBS  Masters </em></p>
    <p>&quot;It was one of those Chinese expressions that means the better half  of good intentions.  I can't remember  things I didn't understand in the first place.&quot; <br>
